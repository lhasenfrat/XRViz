# About


## Brief description
Software toolbox dedicated to the integrative and robust analysis of data collected 
using research protocols on humans immersed in virtual reality (VR). 
It is a complement / backend to XR-echo.


## Context
Virtual reality (VR) offers a privileged context for the implementation of research protocols 
on humans with a good compromise between immersion and experimental control. 
This technology makes it possible to obtain rich and contextualized multimodal data 
to understand and model the relationships between:
- the characteristics of the user (e.g., demographic profile, personality traits, etc.),
- objective behavior in the virtual environment (e.g., traces of interactions, spatial movements, visual attention, etc.), 
- physiological activity (e.g., heart rate, micro-sweating, respiratory movements, etc.),
- subjective perception and feelings during the experience (e.g., flow, engagment, etc.).
This requires a software toolbox dedicated to the integrative and robust analysis of these multimodal data.
Typical data analysis pipeline includes several key steps in order to obtain an efficient representation of the data recorded in VR: 
- preprocessing (e.g., normalization, resampling, filtering, etc.) of the raw signals when needed
- selection of the user groups and the relevant experience conditions for a given analysis (e.g., query on data, synchronization on specific events of interest)
- single feature extraction for individual analysis
- composite metrics for multimodal data integration and/or group-wide marker identification.
Note: Unity XREcho plugin is an existing toolbox for recording and viewing behavioral data in VR (see https://github.com/Plateforme-VR-ENISE/XREcho)
